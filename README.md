# Screening Test – Solutions  
Language used: **JavaScript**

I solved all four problems using basic JavaScript.  
Each problem has its own file in this repository.

### Problem-1  
Simple calculator made using a class.  
Supports add, subtract, multiply and divide.

### Problem-2  
This file prints the first `a` odd numbers.  
I used a small loop for this.

### Problem-3  
This one prints odd numbers based on the pattern shown in the test.  
If the number is even, I used `a-1` as the limit.

### Problem-4  
Counts how many numbers in a list are multiples of 1 to 9.  
I used two loops and stored the results in an object.

There are no external libraries or anything extra used.  
Just plain JavaScript.
